Autocompletion for Swift in [NeoVim][web-neovim] with [deoplete][github-deoplete].

![completion-gif](/_images/completion.gif)


## Announcement

**Autocompletion-swift dropped support for Vim and completion with omni-function**.
Please use this plugin in NeoVim with deoplete.nvim.


## Installation

Autocomplete-swift uses [SourceKitten][github-sourcekitten] as its back-end.
Therefore this plugin supports macOS only.
SourceKitten can be installed with [Homebrew][github-homebrew].

Please execute the following command:

```bash
$ brew install sourcekitten
```

To install autocomplete-swift,
it is recommended to use plugin manager such as [dein.vim][github-dein].
In the case of dein.vim, please add the following codes into `init.vim` and configure them:

```vim
call dein#add('Shougo/deoplete.nvim')
call dein#add('mitsuse/autocomplete-swift')
```

This plugin also supports jumping to placeholders in arguments of method.
The following configuration is required:

```vim
" Jump to the first placeholder by typing `<C-k>`.
autocmd FileType swift imap <buffer> <C-k> <Plug>(autocomplete_swift_jump_to_placeholder)
```

If you use [neosnippet][github-neosnippet],
you should enable [key-mappings of neosnippets][github-neosnippet-config] instead of using the above code.
Autocomplete-swift gets along with neosnippet by converting placeholders into its ones.


## Features

### Completion

Autocomplete-swift supports types of completion as follow:

- Type name
- Type/Instance member
- Function/method/initializer parameter
- Top-level function/constant/variable
- Keyword such as `protocol`, `extension` etc.
- Method definition


### Placeholder

This plugin supports jumping to placeholders in arguments of method.
Please read [Installation](#installation).


### Xcode Project Support

Autocomplete-swift experimentally supports completion with framework/SDK
by communicating with [SourceKittenDaemon][github-sourcekittendaemon].

After launching SourceKittenDaemon,
execute `call sourcekitten_daemon#enable({port_number})` in NeoVim.


#### Xcode <= 7.3.1

Please use the original [SourceKittenDaemon][github-sourcekittendaemon].


#### Xcode 8.0+

You can use [the forked version of SourceKittenDaemon][github-mitsuse/sourcekittendaemon] for Xcode 8.0 as a **workaround**.
Please checkout `support-xcode8.0` branch.

It can switch toolchains with `TOOLCHAINS` variable.
For excample, set `com.apple.dt.toolchain.Swift_2_3` to the variable for Swift 2.3.


## TODO

- Display more information of candidate (For example, the kind of candidate etc).
- Make configurable. For example, autocomplete-swift will get `max_candiates` for neocomplete from a variable.
- Add support for Linux.
